# GameCo Analysis
GameCo is a fictional video game company requesting global sales analysis to help with developing their marketing budget for 2017.
## Objective
The analysis will not only help inform the marketing budget, but will also help GameCo gain a better understanding of how their games will fair in the market. The company's current understanding is that regional sales have remained the same over time. The goal is to not only see if this holds true, but to also look at which publishers will be main competitors, if certain games have changed in popularity, what are popular genres, and popular platforms.
## Data
The dataset was sourced from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/). It includes physical game sales from 1980-2016 but doesn't contain financial numbers.
